Required downloads
------------------

Matplotlib
NumPy
Pygame

To determine whether you need to download any of these, type at the terminal
  python
  import numpy
  import matplotlib
  import pygame
If Python cannot find any of these, you can install it from your package
manager.  The Matplotlib package is usually called python-matplotlib.  For
NumPy, visit http://www.scipy.org/scipylib/download.html and scroll to the
bottom of the page to find the name of the numpy package for your distribution.
For Pygame, consult the Unix Distributions section of
http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml for the name of the pygame package.

To run the warm-up
------------------
At the terminal type
  python policy_iter.py
The output is
  (1) a printout of the value function and the optimal policy, and
  (2) a bar graph of the value function.
Note that the policy printout gives the array index of the square rather than
point value.

To run the Swingy Monkey learner
--------------------------------
At the terminal type
  python q_learn.py
This brings up the Swingy Monkey graphics window and prints the score for each
epoch and the current average score to the console.  After 100 iterations, the
output is
  (1) a printout of the bin distribution, and
  (2) a bar graph of the rolling average of the score.
