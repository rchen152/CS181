Summary
-------

We implemented two classification models in Python.

Files
-----

1. logistic_reg.py
2. gaussian.py
3. fruit.csv

Required downloads
------------------

Matplotlib
NumPy

Many Python installations come with these pre-installed.
To determine whether you need to download them, type at the terminal
  python
  import numpy
  import matplotlib
If Python cannot find either of these, you can install it from your package
manager.  The Matplotlib package is usually called python-matplotlib.  For
NumPy, visit http://www.scipy.org/scipylib/download.html and scroll to the
bottom of the page to find the name of the numpy package for your distribution.

To classify the data in fruit.csv
---------------------------------
At the terminal type
    python logistic_reg.py
to get a plot of the data and decision boundaries for logistic regression and
    python gaussian.py
to get a plot of the data and decision boundaries for a generative classifier
with Gaussian class-conditional densities.
